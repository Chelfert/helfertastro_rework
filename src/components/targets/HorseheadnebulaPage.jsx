        description={`The Horsehead Nebula, located in the constellation Orion just south of the star Alnitak, is approximately 1,375 light-years away from Earth. 
                This dark nebula, part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, is a dense region of gas and dust that blocks the light from stars behind it, giving it a distinctive shape resembling a horseâ€™s head. The nebula spans about 3.5 light-years in height and 2.5 light-years in width. 
                Known for its active star formation, the Horsehead Nebula is a fascinating site where new stars are being born, contributing to the dynamic processes within our galaxy.`}
